                    <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p> I am an enthusiastic, punctual and self-motivated person. I am able to work well both in a team environment as well as using own initiative. I am able to work well under pressure and I am willing to learn and develop new skills. 
                I previously worked as a manager in fast food restaurants. I recently decided to shift my career to a web developer one. Programming was a passion of mine since I was younger and know I decided to pursue it. I am a self taught in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other programs. I am excited for a new chapter in my live. Have a nice day!

                        <p> I was responsible with coordinating people and supervise them to make sure we produce and sell high standard products every day. Other day-to-day responsibilities include positioning people so that everyone is on their best role, dealing with customers complains and solving them as fast as possible. I was in charge with all the earnings during my shift, making sure there were no money missing, and dealing with other equipment problems that might have appeared. </p>

                        <p> My day-to-day responsibilities were to maintain the company’s website (updating prices, promotions, add new products) and process the online orders that were made by the customers. I designed the website and create banners that we use to advertise new products or brands that are available for sales. I am also responsible with the Social Media activity of the firm, as I spend my time making sure as many persons, primary on Facebook, hear about our page and see our latest updates. I have proven having good communication skills since I talk daily with the customers that wrote us on our Facebook page, e-mail, via the website’s contact form, or by telephone. The usually questions the customers have are about the offers, why is a delay in their products arrival time or returns.</p>
